# Evidence Log — Day 1

## Date
2025-12-21

## Objective
Establish an enterprise-grade, audit-ready repository baseline with version control, accountability, and recovery capability.

## What Was Built
- A structured enterprise IT lab repository
- Enforced operating standards for daily work
- Evidence control plane for audit and verification

## Controls Enforced
- Version-controlled change management using Git
- Author attribution and timestamped history
- Separation between work artifacts and proof (evidence)

## Verification Performed
- Verified repository state using `git status`
- Confirmed immutable history via Git commit log
- Published evidence to GitHub for external review

## Failure Injection
- Simulated accidental deletion of evidence documentation

## Recovery
- Successfully restored deleted evidence using Git history
- Verified recovery without recreating files manually

## Risk Mitigated
- Untraceable changes
- Lack of accountability
- Inability to reconstruct actions after failure
- Reliance on screenshots or memory as proof

## Reviewer Notes
This evidence demonstrates baseline operational discipline, audit thinking, and controlled recovery aligned with enterprise and government IT expectations.
