Clarence Enterprise IT Lab — Operating Standard (Day 1 Baseline)


\## Mission

This repository is an enterprise-grade, audit-ready lab portfolio designed to prove Level 3–4 IT capability.


\## Rules of Engagement (Non-Negotiable)

1\. Every day produces ONE real-world project with evidence.

2\. Every project follows this exact order:

&nbsp;  Design → Build → Enterprise Baseline Hardening → Verify →

&nbsp;  Security Pre-Test → Failure Injection → Recovery →

&nbsp;  Documentation → Teach-Back → Active Recall

3\. No vague steps. Every command must be explained and verified.

4\. No advancement without proof (screenshots/logs/config outputs).



\## Evidence Policy (Audit-Ready)

\- All proof goes in: /99-EVIDENCE/2025-12-21/

\- Evidence must include:

&nbsp; - Command outputs (copy/paste)

&nbsp; - Screenshots where applicable

&nbsp; - Config files (sanitized)

&nbsp; - A short “What this proves” statement


\## Safety / Ethics

This lab is for defensive, professional learning. No attack playbooks.


\## Daily Handoff

Each day ends with:

\- What was built

\- What was verified

\- What broke (failure injection)

\- How it was recovered

\- Next-day starting point
